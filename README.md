# Introduction
This project was created for the NG30days of learning and to test out my capabilities, and discover new insights. The documentation includes:
•	Data Gathering & Transformation
•	Data Modelling
•	Report Design
•	Data Insights
•	Data Limitation
•	Conclusion

# Data Gathering & Transformation
The data was gotten from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/main/Airline%20Project/Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv
The data was originally created on kaggle in September 206 but the original version was hosted by Open Data by socrata at: https://opendata.socrata.com/government/airplane-crashes-and-fatalities-since-1908/q2te-8cvq (no longer available). The dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil, commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08

# Report Design
The layout of this report was designed using Microsoft Power BI

# Data Insights
•	The year 1972 recorded the highest number fatalities in the year under review. It recorded 72 airliner crashes, it wasn’t the largest number of crashes recorded per year but due to the larger sizes of aircrafts, those 72 crashes killed many more people
•	The Tenerife-LasPalmas/LasPalmas-Tenerife route recorded the highest number of fatalities
•	The Tenerife, canary islands recorded the highest crash most likely due to the fact that the Tenerife-lasPalmas/LasPalmas-Tenerife route recorded the highest number of fatalities
•	The Douglas DC-3 recorded the highest number of fatalities most likely due to the fact that it was used during the world war II. It had a lasting effect on the airline industry in the 1930s to 1940s and World War II. It was developed as a larger, improved 14-bed sleeper version of the Douglas DC-2
•	In addition to passenger flights, Aeroflot also committed to freight operations and serving the state through transportation and military assistance, which explains why they record a high amount of fatality


Random facts:
The major causes of plane crashes include;
•	Pilot error
•	Mechanical error
•	Inclement weather
•	Air traffic controller error
Contrary to popular opinion, only 12% of plane crashes were caused by bad weather

# Limitation
Missing values, which hindered me from carrying out a more extensive report


----
# Conclusion
Plane crashes are very fatal and appropriate measures should always be taken by airlines to avoid such occurences
