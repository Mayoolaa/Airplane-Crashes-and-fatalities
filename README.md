# Data Gathering & Transformation
The data was originally created on kaggle in September 206 but the original version was hosted by Open Data by socrata at: https://opendata.socrata.com/government/airplane-crashes-and-fatalities-since-1908/q2te-8cvq (no longer available). The dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil, commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08
